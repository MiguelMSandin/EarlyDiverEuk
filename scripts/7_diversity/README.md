# 7_diversity/

Here we will calculate the fraction of the diversity that our trees correspond to.  
The estimation of the total number of eukaryotic *species* is a debated topic of research. Such estimates goes from 1.8-2 million *species* ([Costello et al., 20212](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/61/5/871/1734723)) to 5±3 million *species* ([Costello et al., 2013](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.1230318)) or with narrower estimates pointing at 8.7 ± 1.3 million *species* ([Mora et al., 2011](https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1001127)).  
Here we will use different and simpler approaches to provide a maximum and minimum boundaries. To do so, we will define *species* as 99% 18S rDNA sequences and therefore avoiding any further ambiguity in the concept of species (see [Queiroz (2007)](https://academic.oup.com/sysbio/article/56/6/879/1653163) or [Zachos (2016)](https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-319-44966-1) for further details on the so-called the *species* problem).
